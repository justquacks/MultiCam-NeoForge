The original makers of this mod are freaking awesome because they are the only mod in the world that fit my exact needs, I just REALLY needed it in neoforge.

Also, I just updated my PC to Windows 11, I refuse to download git or anything else right now since its 4AM, i will be manually adding files to this repo through the browser, I am evil.
